Grails Plugin for Sanitizing Markup using the Antisamy library.

Project HomePage:  http://www.grails.org/plugin/sanitizer

To Install add it to your BuildConfig.groovy:
build ":sanitizer:0.9.0"

Once you've compiled the project after adding the above line, install your preferred
antisamy policy with:
grails antisamy 1
Where 1 is the number of the policy.  You can get the policy numbers by running
grails antisamy

From there, you can use antisamy from the MarkupSanitizerServce, the SanitzedMarkupCodec, or the Domain Constraint.

You can add this config value to Config.groovy
sanitizer.trustSanitizer=true
By default, if there is a message given by the sanitizer during cleaning, the sanitizer codec will return an empty string.  
Setting trustSanitizer to true will allow you to ignore the messages issued by the sanitizer and just use the output.


In Progress:
Simplify plugin so as to be easily maintainable
Store sanitizer files in src tree to be selected by config

TODO:
Optionally export sanitizer files to WEB-INF for modification
Update test plugins for changes
Fix Tests
